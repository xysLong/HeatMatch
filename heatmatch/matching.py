HeatMatch Similarity

Computes pairwise similarity scores between two saccade orientation fields.

- Locational similarity S_loc: Pearson correlation of density maps ρ, rescaled to [0, 1].
- Directional similarity S_dir: density- and coherence-weighted sum of per-point axial
  angular similarities, using geometric-mean overlap weights, with a density-coherence
  trade-off parameter ∈ [0, 1].

    ----------
    field_a, field_b : OrientationField
        Precomputed orientation fields from make_orientation_field.
    density_coherence_tradeoff : float in [0, 1]
        Controls how much S_dir weights grid points by density vs. coherence.
        At 1.0 the weight is purely density-based and angular coherence has no influence,
